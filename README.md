**Executive Summary**

This research note explores the optimal strategy to distribute COVID-19 swab tests under varying state budgets initially in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, but a priori strategies can be used in neighbouring states under similar budgets. The plan starts by assuming no budgetary constraint and considers a progressive increase in an 18-million-rupee daily budget cap until the maximum area is selected under the constraint (to maximise test coverage but not compromise access to testing and ensure equal access to both). We show that equal sampling areas and populations does not lead to equal sampling if the testing laboratory capacities are different across locations, and we demonstrate that this contradiction can be resolved by combining information on swab collections, demography and differential testing laboratory capacities in each district to achieve an optimal, fair, data-driven allocation.


**Introduction**

Ensuring effective use of testing resources and deployments of gold standard tests is critical to curtail the spread of the advancing COVID-19 epidemic, and to inform and guide public health decisions. Raipur, Chhattisgarh, faces unique challenges due to its dispersed population and workplaces. We present a strategic deployment algorithm for swab tests that prioritises areas accounting for demographic, economic, and logistic concerns.


**Methodology**

Derived an optimisation model that incorporates cost into it, with information from the Excel spreadsheet that holds the swab samples and distances between the labs. This model will help calculate or set how parameters such as the limit of the allocated budget and frequency of the allocation (either daily or weekly) affect testing distribution. Based on the number of the population density, the infection rate, and distance between the labs, I hope this study will yield optimal distribution of tests.


**Analysis**

**First Scenario (No Budget Limits):**
There were high-risk and high-density areas that they wanted to prioritise so therefore vaccines would be widely distributed and the human response to pandemic disease would be fast. 


**Weekly compared with Daily Allocation:**
Daily allocation could result in increased logistical overhead but facilitates flexible, responsive distribution.
A weekly ration, while increasing logistical productivity, is likely to promote a learning lag that awaits the movement of new hotspots.
For balance, a hybrid methodology with midweek updates based on real-time data is encouraged.

**Budget-Restricted Conditions:**
It can’t be test for every ag Neilson sheet in the country for 18 million rupees – have to pick and choose the battle. There are market pressures on the testing. Supplying high-risk locations doesn’t change, but if there’s a profit-and-loss thing, it influences the amount of testing and possibly where testing is provided.


**Recommendations:**

**Hybrid Allocation Model:** Use a flexible, polythetic mechanism to allocate tests, maximising efficiency and flexibility while allowing for change. 

**Strategic order of importance:** determine the level of testing in the region as a whole to stop the rapid spread of the virus in less monitored districts, by carrying out, as soon as possible, a mass testing of the most at-risk districts, but keeping an overall level of testing appropriate for the whole region. 

**Clearance considerations:** Make sure you cover everyone over 20-months-old in your population, unless they have already been screened, or have a hearing-related disorder. Cost-consciousness: Maximise ‘value for money’ through ‘bulk-purchasing’ and negotiating with the provider.

**Transparent Communication:** Keep the public appraised of testing procedures, priorities, and any modifications to the allocation scheme. 


**Financial Implications**

The budget constraint case highlights the need for a judicious balance between spending control and coverage of test availability. The efficiency of the spending is increased by careful planning of procurement and a focus on high-efficiency delivery schedules. The study also points towards a saturation, an inflexion points beyond which, while spending increases above the marginal cost of an antigen test, availability does not increase correspondingly.


**Conclusions**

Since any act of public outreach involving COVID-19 swab tests in Raipur must be conceived and executed through a data-driven, flexible policy that also responds to emerging conditions and constraints, the town can substantially enhance its response to its pandemic by restoring a balance between the public health imperative and the mundane, budgetary, and logistical issues involved in performing it on a day-to-day basis. Such a balance holds out the promise of equitable access to testing and better control of the COVID-19 spread. Subsequently, steps must then persist in assessing the ever-evolving ground realities and integrating feedback and collated information to refine transmission plans.
